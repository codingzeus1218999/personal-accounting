- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class is responsible for only one purpose:

Drivers (e.g., `JsonCurrencyDriver`, `XmlCurrencyDriver`) are responsible only for fetching and parsing data.
`TransactionController` is responsible only for transaction-related API operations.
`CurrencyDriverFactory` handles creating driver instances.
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes are open for extension but closed for modification:

Adding new drivers (e.g., a new `ApiCurrencyDriver`) requires no modification of existing classes; it just involves creating a new driver and registering it in the factory.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The drivers (`JsonCurrencyDriver`, `XmlCurrencyDriver`, `CsvCurrencyDriver`) inherit from `CurrencyDriver` and can be used interchangeably wherever `CurrencyDriver` is expected.
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Not directly implemented in this task as no unnecessary interfaces were created, but abstract classes like `CurrencyDriver` ensure subclasses only implement required methods.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules (e.g., `CurrencyConverterFacade`) do not depend on low-level modules (e.g., drivers) but on abstractions (`CurrencyDriver`).

- Controller-Model Separation: The controller handles API requests, and models handle database logic.
- Middleware: Responsibilities like updating `last_seen` or checking authentication are moved to middleware, following the SRP.
- Factory Pattern: The factory dynamically selects the appropriate driver, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- Caching and Broadcasting: The use of Laravel's built-in systems (e.g., caching, events) ensures modularity and extensibility without custom solutions.

1. Describing Classes and Methods:
- Clearly explaining the purpose and behavior of the code.
- Specifying parameter types, return types, and any exceptions thrown.
2. Improving Readability and Collaboration:
- Helps other developers understand the code without diving into implementation details.
- Supports IDE autocompletion and error detection.

<b>Advantages of Typing:</b>
- Code Reliability
- Improved Readability
- Better Tooling

<b>Disadvantages of Typing:</b>
- Overhead in Small Projects
- Dynamic Nature of PHP

<b>When to Use Typing:</b>
- Use typing when building large, collaborative, or long-term projects where clarity and reliability are essential

<b>When to Avoid Typing:</b>
- Avoid typing in experimental or rapid prototyping code where requirements might frequently change.
- For highly dynamic or polymorphic code where strict typing might lead to verbose or redundant checks.
